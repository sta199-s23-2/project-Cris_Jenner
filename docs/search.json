    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nIdentify the source of the data.\nThe dataset is from the Pew Research Center.\nState when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).\nThe main personnel on the study include Nicole Neuenschwander, An Liu, and Wendy Mansfield, who were all part of a team at Ipsos Public Affairs. It was collected in 2018, and they ran a survey of 2791 US adult twitter users that were willing to share information about their twitter usage. Stratified random sampling was used to ensure that participants’ backgrounds mimicked those of the adult population in the US. Participants received an email with a survey link. \nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nParticipants were asked a large range of questions. The main observations were about twitter usage (do you use twitter, how often do you use twitter), participant’s political leanings (liberal or conservative), and questions about participant’s background and hobbies like volunteer work, views on abortion and participant’s views on themselves."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\nWhat is the factor of an individual’s identity that predicts amount of twitter usage the most? Some examples of our questions include:\n\nWhat is the relationship between education level and twitter usage?\nWhat is the relationship between political leaning and twitter usage?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nOur research topic encompasses how different aspects of identities affect how much people use twitter. So far, our hypotheses include:\n\nLeft-leaning people use Twitter most often.\nHighly-educated individuals use Twitter most often.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nMost of the variables are categorical, like amount of twitter usage. It is on a scale of “Several Times a Day” to “Once a Month or Less”. However, they are converted to numerical values in R. Political leaning is quantitative on scales of 1-10, and education level is categorical on a similar scale to the twitter usage amount."

Overall, US twitter users are younger and more likely to be Democratic than the general American public. 22% of twitter users are representative of Americans, but there is some variability in political leaning, education, and incomes. They also found that a large majority of tweets come from a small percentage of twitter users. There are only modest differences between twitter users that tweet a lot, and the bottom 90% of twitter users in political views.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nWhile the article talks a lot about twitter usage, it is mostly comparing twitter users to the American population in general. Our research question focuses on the relationship between the variables within the dataset to twitter usage."

They found that Asians in the United States are the group with the most income inequality, and this inequality doubled since 1970. They also found that Asians have the highest incomes among racial/ethnic groups, but there is a lot of disparity among Asian Americans. They found that income gaps based on ethnicity/race still exist, and some of it is due to immigration.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question will look at more factors than just income levels.

This article was published on February, 23rd 2017, about a month after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The article analyzes how confident Latinos feel about their place in America, how they feel like their situation has changed since Trump was elected, and their concerns about deportation. In summarizing the data, Latinos who were US citizens had the least concerns about their place in America at 34%. Almost half of the Hispanics in this country felt as if their situation was “about the same” as it was a year ago, 32% felt that it was worse, and 16% felt as if it was improved. 47% of all Hispanics had at least some deportation concerns, and were higher for groups who were not US-born or US citizens. Additionally, the top issue most Hispanics ranked as their number one priority was improving the nation’s educational system.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nWe hope to extrapolate from this data that those who were “comfortable in their place in America” supported Trump’s presidency, which provides a new layer of interesting data correlations, like immigration status, education level, etc."

    "text": "There are persistent problems and injustices in the United States around educational and income inequality. For our research project, we are going to examine what factors influence career outcomes (one’s education and income) by looking at data from over 3,000 counties in the United States. In many cases, these education and income are very interrelated for families and counties causing or exacerbating a vicious cycle that can be hard to break. In America, there are many root causes that contribute to such a cycle, and it is important they are clearly researched and evaluated, so changes can start to be made to populations and counties that need them most. There are many factors that can influence one’s career outcomes, but some particularly important ones are education level, ethnicity, gender, and state. According to the APLU, people who hold college degrees are twice as likely to get a job and make around an extra $1.2 million over the course of their life (APLU). Black or Latino families make around 50% of what white households do, according to the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve Board). The gender pay gap still persists, with women earning an average of 82% of what men do (PEW Research Center). On the state level, various factors such as funding per county and class disparities can impact income inequality as well. There are intersections in everyone’s identities and therefore the counties identities as well, and when combined, can have even greater impacts on career outcomes, so knowing which specific identities are most vulnerable is also a key step to making actionable change. We believe counties with residents with higher levels of education, a higher white population, more males, and live in states with greater funding and job opportunities will have better career outcomes. Since this data has been gathered by the US Census Bureau, a government organization, there should be no ethical concerns. They adhere to strict privacy policy guidelines to ensure a confidential, respectful, and transparent experience for participants when collecting data (United States Census Bureau).\nhttps://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy/data_stewardship/our_privacy_principles.html\nhttps://www.aplu.org/our-work/4-policy-and-advocacy/publicuvalues/employment-earnings/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20that%20a%20college,on%20average%20over%20their%20lifetime.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/wealth-inequality-and-the-racial-wealth-gap-20211022.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,percent%20as%20much%20net%20wealth.\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/#:~:text=The%20gender%20gap%20in%20pay,%2D%20and%20part%2Dtime%20workers.\n\nData\nThe dataset we are analyzing is from The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets (CORGIS) Project. Furthermore, it was collected using 2010 to 2019 data from the United States Census Bureau. It should be noted that some of the estimates came from sample data. The dataset includes a wide variety of observations for various counties in the United States. In order to best serve our research question, we will focus on the statistics such as education level, ethnicity, age, gender, and state. The data is largely qualitative and in terms of what percentage of the county fits a certain description such as being a high school graduate or white.\n\nMethodology\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(usmap)\nlibrary(geofacet)\n\n\ncounties <- read_csv(\"data/county_demographics.csv\")\n\nglimpse(counties)\n\nRows: 3,139\nColumns: 43\n$ County
