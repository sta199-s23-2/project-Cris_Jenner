    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nIdentify the source of the data.\nThe dataset is from the Pew Research Center.\nState when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).\nThe main personnel on the study include Nicole Neuenschwander, An Liu, and Wendy Mansfield, who were all part of a team at Ipsos Public Affairs. It was collected in 2018, and they ran a survey of 2791 US adult twitter users that were willing to share information about their twitter usage. Stratified random sampling was used to ensure that participants’ backgrounds mimicked those of the adult population in the US. Participants received an email with a survey link. \nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nParticipants were asked a large range of questions. The main observations were about twitter usage (do you use twitter, how often do you use twitter), participant’s political leanings (liberal or conservative), and questions about participant’s background and hobbies like volunteer work, views on abortion and participant’s views on themselves."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\nWhat is the factor of an individual’s identity that predicts amount of twitter usage the most? Some examples of our questions include:\n\nWhat is the relationship between education level and twitter usage?\nWhat is the relationship between political leaning and twitter usage?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nOur research topic encompasses how different aspects of identities affect how much people use twitter. So far, our hypotheses include:\n\nLeft-leaning people use Twitter most often.\nHighly-educated individuals use Twitter most often.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nMost of the variables are categorical, like amount of twitter usage. It is on a scale of “Several Times a Day” to “Once a Month or Less”. However, they are converted to numerical values in R. Political leaning is quantitative on scales of 1-10, and education level is categorical on a similar scale to the twitter usage amount."

Overall, US twitter users are younger and more likely to be Democratic than the general American public. 22% of twitter users are representative of Americans, but there is some variability in political leaning, education, and incomes. They also found that a large majority of tweets come from a small percentage of twitter users. There are only modest differences between twitter users that tweet a lot, and the bottom 90% of twitter users in political views.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nWhile the article talks a lot about twitter usage, it is mostly comparing twitter users to the American population in general. Our research question focuses on the relationship between the variables within the dataset to twitter usage."

They found that Asians in the United States are the group with the most income inequality, and this inequality doubled since 1970. They also found that Asians have the highest incomes among racial/ethnic groups, but there is a lot of disparity among Asian Americans. They found that income gaps based on ethnicity/race still exist, and some of it is due to immigration.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question will look at more factors than just income levels.

This article was published on February, 23rd 2017, about a month after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The article analyzes how confident Latinos feel about their place in America, how they feel like their situation has changed since Trump was elected, and their concerns about deportation. In summarizing the data, Latinos who were US citizens had the least concerns about their place in America at 34%. Almost half of the Hispanics in this country felt as if their situation was “about the same” as it was a year ago, 32% felt that it was worse, and 16% felt as if it was improved. 47% of all Hispanics had at least some deportation concerns, and were higher for groups who were not US-born or US citizens. Additionally, the top issue most Hispanics ranked as their number one priority was improving the nation’s educational system.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nWe hope to extrapolate from this data that those who were “comfortable in their place in America” supported Trump’s presidency, which provides a new layer of interesting data correlations, like immigration status, education level, etc."

    "title": "After accounting for state, which variable accounts for the most variability in median household income?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There are persistent problems and injustices in the United States surrounding income inequality. For our research project, we are going to examine the question: After accounting for state, which variable accounts for the most variability in median household income? In order to investigate this question, we will look at data coming from over 3,000 counties and all 50 states in the United States. In many cases, income levels and location (such as more vulnerable states and counties) are very interrelated for families in terms of accessing improved educational opportunities and resources, causing or exacerbating a vicious cycle that can be hard to break. In America, there are many root causes that contribute to such a cycle, and it is important they are clearly researched and evaluated, so changes can start to be made to states and therefore, populations that need them most. There are many factors that can influence one’s career outcomes, but some particularly important ones that we are going to focus on are education level, ethnicity, gender, and age. According to the APLU, people who hold college degrees are twice as likely to get a job and make around an extra $1.2 million over the course of their life (APLU). Black or Latino families make around 50% of what white households do, according to the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve Board). The gender pay gap still persists, with women earning an average of 82% of what men do (PEW Research Center). Income can also vary with age, as people’s income typically peaks right before retirement (so around age 65). It is also important to note that on the state level, various factors such as funding per county and class disparities impact income inequality as well, which is something that we could observe beyond this project after identifying states that are particularly vulnerable. There are intersections in everyone’s identities and, thereby the states’ identities as well, and when combined, can have even greater impacts on career outcomes, so knowing which specific identities are most vulnerable is also a key step to making actionable change. We believe states with residents with higher levels of education, a higher white population, and more males will have high median household incomes. Since this data has been gathered by the US Census Bureau, a government organization, there should be no ethical concerns. They adhere to strict privacy policy guidelines to ensure a confidential, respectful, and transparent experience for participants when collecting data (United States Census Bureau).\nhttps://www.census.gov/about/policies/privacy/data_stewardship/our_privacy_principles.html\nhttps://www.aplu.org/our-work/4-policy-and-advocacy/publicuvalues/employment-earnings/#:~:text=The%20evidence%20that%20a%20college,on%20average%20over%20their%20lifetime.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/wealth-inequality-and-the-racial-wealth-gap-20211022.html#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20the,percent%20as%20much%20net%20wealth.\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/#:~:text=The%20gender%20gap%20in%20pay,%2D%20and%20part%2Dtime%20workers.\n\nData\nThe dataset we are analyzing is from The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets (CORGIS) Project. The data was collected from 2010 to 2019 by the United States Census Bureau. It should be noted that some of the estimates came from sample data. The dataset includes a wide variety of observations for various counties in the United States. In order to best serve our research question, we will focus on the statistics such as education level, ethnicity, age, and gender as well as respective state and median household income. The data is largely qualitative and in terms of what percentage of the county fits a certain description such as being a high school graduate or white, although there are some quantitative variables such as state and county.\n\nMethodology\nWe began by loading in the necessary libraries and obtained the county demographic data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaming Variables\nWe renamed our variables of interest because our dataset’s variables were too long. We focused on the variables of median household income (“income”), the percentage of the county that had a bachelor’s degree or higher (“education”), the percentage of the county that was female (“percent_female”), the percentage of the county that was 65 years and older (“age”), and the percentage of the county that was White and not Hispanic (“percentage_white”).\n\n\n\nGraph of Income Versus State\nTo start our exploratory data analysis, we wanted to see how income varied across states. So, we made a heat map of the United States with different colors denoting different median household income levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first summarized our data (finding median income) and manipulated it (using full_join) in order to create a Choropleth map of the US. Each state is colored based on median household income. We chose to create these maps as they helped us visualize general geographic patterns within the US based on the spectrum of colors by state. The states that are colored darker (such as purple and blue) have lower median household incomes, whereas those that are lighter colors (like yellow and green) are states that have higher median household incomes.\nThis visualization allows us to see that there are greater income disparities in the southeatern states, especially Mississippi, and that there is a generally higher median household income in the western and northeastern states, especially New Jersey.\nGraphs of Income Versus Different Variables\nIncome vs. Education Level\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line of best fit of this scatter plot suggests a moderately strong, positive correlation between median education level per county and median household income per county in thousands.\nIncome vs. Percent Female\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line of best fit of this scatter plot suggests no correlation, or an extremely weak positive correlation, between female percentages per county and median household income per county in thousands.\nIncome vs. Age 65 and Older\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line of best fit of this scatter plot suggests no correlation, or an extremely weak positive correlation, between percent aged 65 and older per county and median household income per county in thousands.\nIncome vs. Percentage White\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line of best fit of this scatter plot suggests a very weak positive correlation between white percentage per county and median household income per county in thousands.\nGiven the results of these preliminary visuals, it seems as though education will be the variable that accounts for the most variability in median household income.\nModels (Linear Regressions)\nBaseline Model\nBefore we created any additive models, we first created a baseline model that only looked at median household income for all of the states. We created a linear regression because the response variable was numeric (median household income). The r-squared value for this model was 0.2923676, meaning that around 29% of the variability in median household income is due to the state.\n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = income ~ State, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)      StateAL      StateAR      StateAZ      StateCA      StateCO  \n    68491.5     -24916.6     -26254.8     -19501.5       -777.9      -9696.7  \n    StateCT      StateDC      StateDE      StateFL      StateGA      StateHI  \n    10709.9      17928.5      -2503.5     -17201.3     -21261.8       7937.1  \n    StateIA      StateID      StateIL      StateIN      StateKS      StateKY  \n   -11231.9     -17569.8     -11835.2     -12624.9     -15626.8     -23609.3  \n    StateLA      StateMA      StateMD      StateME      StateMI      StateMN  \n   -23617.5       9254.1       9050.1     -14922.7     -16683.1      -6835.0  \n    StateMO      StateMS      StateMT      StateNC      StateND      StateNE  \n   -20395.4     -28878.4     -17507.5     -20072.0      -6016.1     -13796.5  \n    StateNH      StateNJ      StateNM      StateNV      StateNY      StateOH  \n      816.7      14395.7     -24768.5      -8371.8      -6006.9     -12691.2  \n    StateOK      StateOR      StatePA      StateRI      StateSC      StateSD  \n   -19780.8     -14538.4     -11435.4       7622.9     -22883.2     -13870.1  \n    StateTN      StateTX      StateUT      StateVA      StateVT      StateWA  \n   -21324.5     -15643.9      -5431.9      -7734.7      -8731.7      -9098.0  \n    StateWI      StateWV      StateWY  \n   -10185.6     -23599.2      -6662.8  \n\n\n[1] 0.2923676\n\n\nNext, we created four different linear regression models that combined state with each variable to see which variable, when combined with state, resulted in the highest variability in median household income. We used r-squared values because each of these models only had 2 variables, so the number of variables would not have an effect on r-squared. We also used additive models instead of interaction models because if we used interaction models, there would be too many coefficients (because of each state). Therefore, for the purposes of clarity, we decided to use additive models. However, in future projects, we could look into interaction models.\nModel with State and Education\n\n\n[1] 0.6129233\n\n\nAccording to the r-squared value of 0.6129233, our additive model with state and education explains roughly 61% of the variability in median household income.\nModel with State and Percent Female\n\n\n[1] 0.2956188\n\n\nAccording to the r-squared value of 0.2956188, our additive model with state and the percentage of people who are female explains roughly 61% of the variability in median household income.\nModel with State and Age 65 and Older\n\n\n[1] 0.3746036\n\n\nAccording to the r-squared value of 0.3746036, our additive model with state and the percentage of people who are 65 years and older explains roughly 37% of the variability in median household income.\nModel with State and Percentage White\n\n\n[1] 0.2985728\n\n\nAccording to the r-squared value of 0.2985728, our additive model with state and the percentage of people who are White and not Hispanic or Latino explains roughly 30% of the variability in median household income.\nResults\nA higher r-squared value means that a greater percentage of the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables. In this case, the dependent variable was median household income. Before creating any additive models, we created a baseline linear regression model that solely focused on the relationship between state and median household income. According to the r-squared value of 0.2923676, around 29% of the variability in median household income is due to the state. We then compared this r-squared value to r-squared values of the four additive models. The r-squared values for state and each of the independent variables for education, age, gender, and ethnicity, respectively, are 0.6129, 0.3746, 0.2956, and 0.2986. Therefore, as the r-squared value for education was the highest (increased the most from the baseline model), it is the best predictor of median household income (when coupled with state) among these four explanatory variables. Additionally, based on the graphs for each variable, education vs. income was also the only graph with a best-fit line with a positive slope.\nAfter the state and education model, the next best model was the additive model with state and the percentage of people who are 65 years and older. The r-squared value was 0.3746, meaning the additive model explains roughly 37% of the variation in median household income. This was not much of an increase from the baseline model that only examined the state. This makes sense because from our exploratory data analysis, the graph of median household income versus percentage of people 65 years and older had a relatively weak and flat correlation.\nThe worst models was the additive model with state and the percentage of people who are White and the additive model with state and the percentage of people who are female. The r-squared value for the first model was 0.2985728, meaning this additive model explains roughly 30% of the variation in median household income. The r-squared value for the second model was 0.2956188, meaning this additive model explains roughly 30% of the variation in median household income. These r-squared values are also not much higher than the r-squared value of the baseline model, which makes sense because the graphs for these variables were relatively weak and flat.\nThe coefficients for each state for the linear regression models represent the change in income for each state compared to the intercept, which is the average of the 50 states (SOMEONE CHECK ON THIS). Excluding Washington D.C., the state with the highest income was New Jersey, with a coefficient of 14395.7, and the state with the lowest income was Mississippi, with a coefficient of -28878.4.\nDiscussion\nThe state of New Jersey had the third highest coefficient (1259.7) in the fitted model between income, state, and education, and Mississippi had the lowest coefficient (-23261.6527). Given that New Jersey was the highest median household income and Mississippi had the lowest, the results of the education model strongly support the conclusion that education is the variable that most accounts for variability in median household income across states."
